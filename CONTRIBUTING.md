Reporting bugs

Please first search existing bug reports (especially closed ones) for a report that matches your issue.

When reporting a bug, provide full details of your environment, that means, at a minimum, package version, OS and OS version, Docker version, env config (ideally a minimal config to reproduce the issue with).

Note that bugs and feature requests are often closed quickly as they are either fixed or deemed wontfix/invalid. This is the only scalable way to manage a bug tracker. Feel free to continue to post to a closed bug report if you would like to discuss the issue further. Being closed does not mean you will not get any more responses.
Contributing code

Install the dependencies using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). Build and run nl2rss from source.

Make a fork, submit your Pull Request. If it's a large/controversial change, open an issue beforehand to discuss it, so that you don't waste your time making a pull request that gets rejected.

If the code you are submitting is reasonably easily testable, please contribute tests as well (see the tests/ sub-directory for existing tests, which can be run with `yarn test`).

That's it.
